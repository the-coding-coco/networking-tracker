# About this project
Easy and intuitive way to manage companies, contacts, and interactions compared to spreadsheets. Developed with MBA students in mind but could be applied to other situations.
# Design goals
- **Easy to use**: Intelligently combine information; no need to type duplicate company or personal information across entries.
- **No centralized database**: User stores their data on their own Google Drive in the form of Google Sheet files. Minimum costs, maximum privacy.
- **Interoperability and Human Readability**: the use of relational database for storage and processing ensures that data can be easily read by humans and other programs on their own, as the structure of the relational database is compatible with the spreadsheet format.
- **Supports recruitment tracking**: Track the positions a user is applying for and all the updates. Interactions are automatically integrated.
